This is the data definition language and triggers for the relational database I created to hold information about museums and their items, as well
as exhibitions, locations, transactions, and other data. A more detailed description of the database is contained in the database explaination powerpoint.
An entity relationship diagram is also included for easy visualization of the database structure.
